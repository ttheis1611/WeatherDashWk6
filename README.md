# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## UTA WK6 - Weather Dashboard using API's
Week 6 challenge for UTA bootcamp.

## GOAL
Create a working dashboard with input for city and get weather data for that area with 5-day forecast as well.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Contributing
There was much help to build a working product. Credit goes to:

    1. Dawson Hensel - help with JavaScript functions for response from openWeather
   
    2. Inspect the JSON from the response payload - https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_json_console.html
   
    3. Using jQuery - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9gXLF-EPcM This video was awesome for helping get this going with JQuery functions
    
    4. Hours of Google searching and preparing to pull all my hair out again. Styling is more difficult for me when I have no help.
